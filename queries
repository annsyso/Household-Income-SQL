# SQL Queries Showcase

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

```sql
-- Rename columns for better readability
ALTER TABLE ushouseholdincome RENAME COLUMN `ALand` TO `Area_Land`;
ALTER TABLE ushouseholdincome RENAME COLUMN `AWater` TO `Area_Water`;
```

```sql
-- Identify duplicate records based on the 'id' column
SELECT id, COUNT(id) AS count
FROM ushouseholdincome
GROUP BY id
HAVING count > 1;
```

```sql
-- Assign row numbers to duplicate records for removal
SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT row_id, id,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY id) as row_num
	FROM ushouseholdincome
	GROUP BY row_id, id
) AS dups
WHERE row_num > 1;
```

```sql
-- Delete duplicate records based on assigned row numbers
DELETE FROM ushouseholdincome
WHERE row_id IN (
	SELECT row_id FROM (
		SELECT row_id, id,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY id) as row_num
		FROM ushouseholdincome
		GROUP BY row_id, id
	) AS dups
	WHERE row_num > 1
);
```

## Data Standardization

```sql
-- Fix a misspelled state name
UPDATE ushouseholdincome
SET State_Name = 'Georgia' WHERE State_Name = 'georia';
```

```sql
-- Fill in missing 'Place' values based on County data
UPDATE ushouseholdincome
SET Place = 'Autaugaville'
WHERE Place = '' AND County = 'Autauga County';
```

```sql
-- Correct lowercase values in the 'Primary' column
UPDATE ushouseholdincome
SET `Primary` = 'Place'
WHERE `Primary` = 'place';
```

```sql
-- Standardize 'Type' column values
UPDATE ushouseholdincome
SET `Type` = 'Borough'
WHERE `Type` = 'Boroughs';

UPDATE ushouseholdincome
SET `Type` = 'CDP'
WHERE `Type` = 'CPD';
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```sql
-- Calculate average land and water area for each state
SELECT State_Name,
ROUND(AVG(Area_Land), 2) AS avg_land,
ROUND(AVG(Area_Water), 2) AS avg_water
FROM ushouseholdincome
WHERE Area_Land <> 0 AND Area_Water <> 0
GROUP BY State_Name;
```

```sql
-- Calculate average land and water area for each county
SELECT State_Name, County,
ROUND(AVG(Area_Land), 2) AS avg_land,
ROUND(AVG(Area_Water), 2) AS avg_water
FROM ushouseholdincome
WHERE Area_Land <> 0 AND Area_Water <> 0
GROUP BY State_Name, County;
```

```sql
-- Identify the counties with the largest land area
SELECT State_Name, County,
ROUND(AVG(Area_Land), 2) AS avg_land,
ROUND(AVG(Area_Water), 2) AS avg_water
FROM ushouseholdincome
WHERE Area_Land <> 0 AND Area_Water <> 0
GROUP BY State_Name, County
ORDER BY avg_land DESC;
```

## Income Analysis

```sql
-- Join household income data with income statistics
SELECT *
FROM ushouseholdincome u
JOIN ushouseholdincome_statistics us
ON u.id = us.id;
```

```sql
-- Analyze income data by state and county
SELECT u.State_Name, u.County, Mean, Median
FROM ushouseholdincome u
JOIN ushouseholdincome_statistics us
ON u.id = us.id
WHERE Mean <> 0;
```

```sql
-- Find the counties with the highest median income
SELECT u.State_Name, u.County,
ROUND(AVG(Median), 2) AS avg_median
FROM ushouseholdincome u
JOIN ushouseholdincome_statistics us
ON u.id = us.id
WHERE Mean <> 0
GROUP BY u.State_Name, u.County
ORDER BY avg_median DESC;
```

```sql
-- Find the top 10 states by median income
SELECT u.State_Name,
ROUND(AVG(Median), 2) AS avg_median
FROM ushouseholdincome u
JOIN ushouseholdincome_statistics us
ON u.id = us.id
WHERE Mean <> 0
GROUP BY u.State_Name
ORDER BY avg_median DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
